## Updating data sources and scenarios üìà

### 1. Replace the CSV files

You can place the new CSV files in `methodology/data/buy.csv` and `methodology/data/rent.csv`

#### CSV columns 

To make sure you don‚Äôt have to change the script, your CSVs should be in a consistent format.

The following columns should be present in the CSV:
- **title** 
  - string
  - ‚ÑπÔ∏è will not affect the visual result
  - the first title at a latlong location group is the name reference in the output data



- **price** 
  - number
  - ‚ö†Ô∏è spelled with 'c' is important for the frontend
  - needs to be formatted with **de-DE** locale, like `1.250,00`, but thousands separators (`.`) and decimals are not necessary


- **size**
  - number
  - needs to be a plain number or **de-DE** locale, like `1.250,00`, but thousands separators (`.`) and decimals are not necessary


- **lat**
  - number
  - needs to be machine-readable number, like `44.1262`


- **long**
  - number
  - needs to be a plain number or  
  - needs to be machine-readable number, like `44.1262`

> Dev notes: The parsing happens in `./methodology/src/readData.ts`. The implementation can be adjusted to parse different columns with different number formats. Which columns are parsed with which format is defined in `./methodology/src/types/offer.ts`.

#### CSV format

The delimiter in the CSVs should be `;` (semi-colon) and the escape character should be `"` (double quotes).

#### Path for the CSV files and naming convention

The methodology scripts expect the original data at this path: `./methodology/data/buy.csv` and `./methodology/data/rent.csv`.

To keep track of previous versions, you can follow the convention to rename the existing `buy.csv` and `rent.csv` files with the prefix of the last modified date with the `YYYYMMDD-<buy/rent>.csv` format.

### 2. Optional: Adjust the scenarios


#### For the methodology
The scenario definitions are found in `methodology/src/allScenarios.ts` 

On line 7 you can change the parameters that calculate the **available income options**

``` TypeScript
export const incomeRangesAndIntervals = [
  { rangeStart: 200, rangeEnd: 1999, interval: 50 }, 
  { rangeStart: 2000, rangeEnd: 3999, interval: 100 },
  { rangeStart: 4000, rangeEnd: 8000, interval: 500 },
]
```

- **rangeStart** defines the number to start with
- **interval** defines the step size by which the numbers get increased in the range
- **rangeEnd**: if the last step increase will be larger that this number it gets discarded


On line 6 you can change the **maximum household size**
``` TypeScript
const maxHouseholdSize = 6
```


On line 22 you can change the **preset definitions**

``` TypeScript
export const scenarios: Scenario[] = [
  { income: 700, size: 1, translateKey: 'scenarios.teacherAlone' },
  { income: 1400, size: 2, translateKey: 'scenarios.workingInEducationCouple' },
  { income: 1700, size: 5, translateKey: 'scenarios.averageFamily3Kids' },
  { income: 620, size: 2, translateKey: 'scenarios.singleMomGroceryStore1Kid' },
  { income: 500, size: 1, translateKey: 'scenarios.retiredFirefighter' },
]
```

#### Optional: For the website

Any changes you make on the numbers in the scenario definitions in the `./methodology` folder will be reflected on the frontend.

The only adjustments you might need to make on the website are related to the translations.

You can find the translation definitions in the folder `./website/i18n` in the files `translations.en.json` and `translations.srp.json`. You can find the scenario translations under the `scenarios` key in the JSON file.


### 3. Run the methodology script

In the folder `./methodology` you can run the script `yarn start` in your terminal. 

You should get the following output:


```
yarn run v1.22.11
$ yarn build && node build/index.js
$ rimraf ./build && tsc
{
  "categoryConfig": {
    "category": "buy",
    "dataPathRelative": "../data/buy.csv"
  }
}
{
  "categoryConfig": {
    "category": "rent",
    "dataPathRelative": "../data/rent.csv"
  }
}
‚ú®  Done in 13.63s.
``` 

‚ÑπÔ∏è The script can run up to around 90 seconds depending on your machine.

### 4. Check results

In the folder `./website` you can run the dev server to check the results.

Just run `yarn dev` and navigate to `localhost:3000` in your browser.


### Optional: Make sure generated types are available

In the folder `./website` run `yarn xstate:typegen`


### 5. Run the build script for the folder

In the folder `./website` run `yarn export:server`
