## About

**As a consequence** of the dominant treatment of the apartment as a commodity that can be exchanged on the market and from which one can profit, even though it is a basic right, housing has become unaffordable for approx. 80% of the inhabitants of Serbia. In addition to the fact that such a high degree of housing unaffordability produces living situations in overcrowded apartments or spaces inadequate for living, as well as the risk of over-indebtedness due to housing costs, it encourages the development of spatial inequality or segregation.

**This website** represents one possible way to quickly and clearly see the scope of the housing unaffordability problem, as well as its spatial consequences. Through exploring our own situations, as well as the situations of our neighbors or friends, we will see to what extent apartments are generally available on the market, but also in which parts of the city we can(not) afford to live. It is the initial step in understanding the problem that we all share and that we can only systematically change through wider mobilization.


## Methodology

**In mapping affordable housing** for the specific situation we all find ourselves in, we used two inputs:
- number of household members (size of the household); and
- self-assessed monthly household income.

In order for the algorithm to calculate the final number of units, as well as the distribution of apartments that are adequate in terms of size and price, we relied on existing international and domestic standards.
In both the cases of renting and buying, the results take into account the following:

1) The first selection criterion refers to the spatially appropriate offers of apartments. Here, the minimum square footage of the apartment in relation to the number of household members was taken into account, according to the "adequate apartment" standard defined by the Law on Housing and Building Maintenance (Article 90).

- for a single-member household - from 22 m2;
- for a two-person household - from 30 m2;
- for a three-member household - from 40 6 m2;
- for a household of four - from 50 m2;
- for a household of five - from 56 m2;
- for a household of six or more - from 64 m2.

This means that the result of the search are all "spatially suitable" apartments, according to the entered household size, corresponding to the legal minimum and those larger than that.

2) The second criterion refers to affordability, based on the internationally adopted definition of the upper limit of the housing cost burden, which amounts to a maximum of 40% of the monthly household income. In the algorithm, however, a threshold of 30% was taken, given that the 40% includes housing costs other than rent and loan installments - utilities and heating.* Therefore, in the case of renting, the selection of "affordable" means all apartments that are spatially suitable, and whose monthly rent is equal to or less than a third of the entered monthly income of the household. In the case of the possibility of purchase, the algorithm will, as a result offer all apartments that are spatially suitable, and which you can buy with loan under the following conditions:

- average interest rates of commercial mortgages in Serbia (2.55%);
- household is creditworthy to apply for a 30-year loan;
- household is able to put a down payment of 20% of the value of the apartment at one time;

so that the monthly installment is in the amount of a third of the household's monthly income or less.
Considering the complex process of downloading data that are not normally available to the public as databases, it is not possible to use the data in real-time mode. Data currently in use has been downloaded on 05.05.2022 / 06.05.2022.


*While at the EU level this percentage is 40%, in the documents of the United Nations this threshold is 30%, which would mean an even smaller range of opportunities obtained as a result.
